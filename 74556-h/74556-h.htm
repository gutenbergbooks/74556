  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The object of this book is to provide not
only a practical list of suggestions that may
be of service to those desirous of securing
good and wholesome literature for their children,
but also one that may be used by the
children themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>This compilation is divided into nineteen
groups, in which the books are graded according
to ages, so that selection may be
readily made, and each book title is followed
by a short descriptive note.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible to draw any absolute line
as to the particular age a boy or girl must
be in order to read and assimilate the contents
of a certain book, such is the difference
in mental development. However, long experience
has shown the compiler what is best
adapted to the average, and the grading has
been done accordingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much care has been used in selecting
books which have some value in assisting the
gradual evolution of the mind or in shaping
character, and which, at the same time, will
make their appeal to the boy or girl.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is said that the child is father of the
man, and in the matter of reading this is
especially applicable. Material delightful
to the hearing, but perhaps in a lesser degree
to the understanding, of a child of from
nine to twelve years of age, yields pleasure
also to the adult; while to children of twelve
to sixteen or seventeen the same material
would be dry and uninteresting; its beauty
is not intuitively perceived by them as by their
younger brothers. For example, let me cite
“Emmy Lou,” by G. M. Martin; “Little
Citizens,” by Myra Kelly, and “Uncle Remus,”
by Joel Chandler Harris. In these
stories there is a bond of sympathy established
in the case of the younger child which
does not apply to his older brother. To
the adult—who has been through the various
phases of life incident to the reaching of
adolescence and maturity—such stories appeal
keenly from a psychological standpoint,
so strong is the bond between adult and
child.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the matter of reading, it must be remembered
that the child of seven is as truly
a critic as the man of seventy; and while it
is the aim of the parent or teacher to put
into the hands of the child such literature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>as will be conducive to his welfare, it is
neither wise nor just to force upon him material
against which he instinctively rebels.
And here is where theory and practice conflict.
I recall that on my eighth birthday a
much interested relative presented me with a
copy of Wm. Matthew’s “Getting on in the
World.” His intentions in making this gift
were admirable; he had my future in view,
and he did what he believed to be a very
correct thing. I might either have read the
book myself or have had it read to me.
The latter I believe was done, my seniors entertaining
the hope that I would thereby be
imbued with ideas which might become the
foundation of future success. Alas! my well-intentioned
relative made the mistake of acting
upon false theory instead of trusting to
his practical common sense. Had the proviso
been made that I should read the book
at, say, the age of fifteen or earlier, should
development allow, the purpose of the donor
might have been met; but as the book was
not suited to my age and understanding, the
result was disappointment to both giver and
receiver. This is mentioned as an instance
of misguided zeal, the giver failing to see
that the child was unable to digest and assimilate
the proffered mental pabulum. It
is only natural that parents should wish their
children to be well informed, and with this
end in view many a fond mother proceeds to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>fill the head of her poor defenceless child
with science, instead of regaling it with nursery
rhymes, folk lore, and fairy tales. Not
infrequently a child will grow up without
having been allowed to read or listen to a
fairy tale. Mythology, travel, history, earth,
sky, etc., but nothing that will not add in
some way to scholarly attainment. Poor
child! he is defrauded by his own parents.
The desire for the beautiful fairy, the wicked
witch, and the ugly giant is natural to a
child. Every human being is endowed with
an imagination which is active and insistent,
and its craving is really the thirst for knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may seem strange, perhaps, that the
nursery rhyme and the fairy tale should be
rungs of the ladder of knowledge. Take
the case of a man at the head of a profession.
He didn’t reach his present height
at a jump, but, beginning with the most elementary
subjects, he acquired his learning by
degrees, until in due course he won prominence.
And so it is with the child: step by
step come the nursery jingle and rhyme, the
fairy tale, simple poetry, etc., all paving the
way for that which requires more strenuous
effort.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be noted that there have been mentioned
the fairy, the witch, and the giant.
The first represents beauty and goodness, the
second wickedness, and the third brute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>strength. In the average fairy tale these
three concomitants are so blended that the
dominating character is the fairy, who eventually
prevails over the machinations of the
wicked witch and the brutal giant. As the
fairy represents love and kindness, a most
important lesson is impressed upon the mind
of the child. There is also a good reason for
the witch and the giant. The child is not
born already civilized, but with natural and
savage instincts. Civilization, which is only
a veneer, is an acquired thing, and it needs
only a scratch to bring the savage instinct to
the surface. The witch and the giant, then,
do their part in appeasing the desire for violence;
and the fact that these disturbing elements
are finally overcome by the good fairy
is a great factor in the early education of the
child.</p>

<p class='c007'>The best collection of tales for very young
children is that known as “Mother Goose
Nursery Tales,” gathered together by Charles
Perrault. The origin of most of these tales
is lost in the shades of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every parent should have in mind the
great importance to the child of the literature
he reads. Much good or much harm
may be the result of the early impressions
gained. The safest way is to procure books
from one who specializes, and who knows the
general trend of the contents of a book.
There are authors and publishers who may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>relied upon for the wholesomeness of their
productions, and with these the book-buyer
will soon become familiar; but the general
output is so large, the authors and publishers
so many, and the tastes so varied, that the
wise book-buyer will rely to a great extent
upon the bookseller in the matter of selection.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a period in the life of almost
every boy when the desire for the sensational
is paramount. Then must the parent be most
watchful, because somehow the boy will secure
reading material which may possibly be
decidedly harmful. How often do we read
of a boy in possession of a cheap revolver or
a bloodthirsty-looking knife being apprehended
while on his way to slay Indians, or
to become a bandit or a pirate. His actions
are almost always directly traceable to the
dime novel or the penny dreadful so easily
procured. Happily there are plenty of books
on the market which will satisfy the boy’s
craving for the wild and adventurous, and
which will at the same time be of some benefit
to him in leading him to become interested
in certain periods of history or in
implanting a desire for information regarding
the geography of this and other countries.</p>

<p class='c007'>From a literary standpoint these books are
as a rule mediocre, but they are valuable as
substitutes for the more lurid effusions. In
this connection may be mentioned the productions
of Stratemeyer, Henty, Otis, Strang,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>Monroe, Stoddard, and Brereton, etc., which
may be given without question to the boy
of from ten to sixteen years. At the age of
twelve to sixteen most boys develop a desire
for school, college, and outing stories, and
numerous authors cater to this taste. Among
the better known of these are Barbour, Home,
Finnemore, Malone, Beach, Hare, Earl, Tomlinson,
and Paine; and all their books for
boys may be relied upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the output of books for boys is
greater than that for girls, there is plenty of
good wholesome literature, suitable to all
ages of girlhood, from which to draw. Up
to the age of nine or ten years the line of
reading for the girl may be substantially the
same as that for her brother, unless it be that
the liking for the fairy tale is more pronounced
in her case. In the matter of a desire
for really good literature it may be said
that the girl is usually more advanced than
the boy. From eleven to fifteen years of age
is the best time for historical tales, such as
those by A. M. Barnes, Lucy F. Madison,
and A. T. Curtis; and from twelve to sixteen
those by Amy Blanchard and Charlotte M.
Yonge. The series of Young Folks’ Histories
by the last named author may be read
by children from ten years up with pleasure
and profit. The justly popular “Little
Women” series by Louisa M. Alcott should
be read by girls of from twelve to sixteen;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>they will not be properly appreciated at an
age younger than twelve. For those of a
more tender age, ranging from seven to
eleven, this author’s other series “The Scrap
Bag,” and “Lulu’s Library,” make good,
wholesome reading. The girl of ten to thirteen
years will be much interested in Marguerite
Bouvet’s “Little Marjorie’s Love
Story,” “Sweet William,” and “A Child of
Tuscany”; while her older sister of sixteen
to eighteen will be delighted with “My
Lady” and “Tales of an Old Chateau,” by
the same author.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of course, there is such temperamental difference
in children that it is absolutely impossible
to draw any hard and fast line in
the matter of reading according to age, but
in the cases of nine out of ten children it is
safe to avoid the theoretical and to accept
the practical. There are children of twelve
taking a high school course, and there are
also children of fifteen in the lower grades;
but these are exceptions and not the rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very important item in the education of
the child is the supplementary reader, and
the idea of training the child’s literary instinct
by this means is fostered by all educators.
There have been much time, thought,
and experience devoted to this subject, and
there are now in use many splendid series,
arranged for the various grades, the high
school, and the college. The field is wide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>and a great wealth of real literature has been
selected, annotated, and arranged, and additions
are continually being made to the already
long list.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the grades, perhaps the best collection
is that by Dr. Charles Eliot Norton called
“The Heart of Oak Books,” in the first
two volumes of which will be found a splendid
selection of fairy tales, fables, wonder
stories, and rhymes. The whole series is
of general excellence. The supplementary
reading should begin with rhymes, fairy
tales, and fables, followed by simple mythology,
legends, and folk lore; then nature stories,
biography, history, stories of travel,
science in story form, art, and the classics of
literature. Four series in which most of
these subjects are contained are Ginn &#38; Co.’s
“Classics for Children” and the “Eclectic
Readings” published by the American Book
Company, “The Riverside Literature Series,”
published by Houghton Mifflin Co., and
Appleton’s “Home Reading Books.” For
the high school student may be recommended
the “Riverside Literature Series,” Longman’s
“English Classics,” “The Lake English
Classics,” and the “Macmillan School
Readings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no question that the supplementary
reader in the school has done much to
improve the literary taste of the pupil, and
it is probable that the regular reader will to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>a great extent be superseded by the supplementary
reader.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now as to illustrations and artists.
For children of one, two, and three years the
rag toy book is very satisfactory. The colors
are bright and attractive, and when soiled
the book may be washed and ironed the same
as a handkerchief. Then there are the linen
books and those mounted on linen. Of these
there are few standards, but titles such as
“The Three Bears,” “Three Little Kittens,”
“A. was an Archer,” “Farmyard Friends,”
“Domestic Animals,” and “Wild Animals”
can almost always be secured. There are
four houses in the United States which pay
special attention to the very young children,—E.
P. Dutton &#38; Co., Raphael Tuck, Sons
&#38; Co., F. Warne &#38; Co., and McLaughlin &#38;
Co., and of these firms only the last does any
actual manufacturing in this country. Perhaps
four-fifths of this class of color work
for the world is done in Germany. Some of
the best examples are the productions of Kate
Greenaway, Leslie Brooke, Randolph Caldecott,
and Walter Crane. These four artists
have given us the best examples of real art
for children, and their picture and toy books
should be a great deal more widely known
than they are. The manufacturing of the
books of these four artists is all done in England;
and for real art, combined with mechanical
excellence, they are absolutely the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>finest picture books ever put before the public.
Among English artists Milicent Sowerby
is well worthy of recognition; among her
delightful books are “Childhood” and “Yesterday’s
Children,” published in America by
Duffield &#38; Co. Among the artists of this
country whose masterpieces depict childhood,
Jessie Willcox Smith stands preëminent. Her
illustrations in “Real Rhymes of Real Children,”
“The Book of the Child,” etc., have
made her the most popular among American
artists whose work is devoted to the delineation
of child life. Books which she has illustrated
and which contain good examples
of her art, besides the two already mentioned,
are “The Child’s Garden of Verses,”
“A Child’s Book of Old Verses,” “Seven
Ages of Childhood,” “The Child’s Book of
Stories,” and “Dream Blocks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of a very different type are the clever and
humorous illustrations by Grace G. Wiederseim,
which may be seen to good advantage
in “Nursery Rhymes from Mother Goose,”
“Kiddie Land,” “Bobby Blake,” and
“Dolly Drake.” Peter Newell has also done
excellent humorous work, such as “The Hole
Book,” “The Slant Book,” “Pictures and
Rhymes,” “Alice in Wonderland,” etc. B.
Cory Kilvert, John Rae, Bessie Pease Gutman,
Hope Dunlap, Ethel Franklin Betts,
and Wilhelmina Seegmiller have all done
most attractive work which appeals to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>younger children. The artist who is capable
of producing illustrations attractive alike to
both child and adult, and which are understood
by both, is what may be termed a
sympathetic genius; he also represents a distinctive
branch of art. All whose names
have been mentioned in this connection possess
this great gift.</p>

<p class='c007'>A splendid series of illustrations is contained
in Boutet de Monvel’s “Joan of Arc.”
This book is for the more mature child, and
is in a class by itself. Maxfield Parrish has
illustrated Eugene Field’s “Poems of Childhood,”
“The Arabian Nights,” Hawthorne’s
“The Wonder Book and Tanglewood Tales,”
and “Mother Goose in Prose” by Frank
Baum, and each illustration is a very worthy
contribution to American art.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two very attractive books are “When Little
Boys Sing” and “Improving Songs for
Anxious Children,” songs for children written
and illustrated by John and Rue Carpenter.
From the standpoint of art these
illustrations are not entitled to any very high
place, but they show originality and humor
of expression.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the later artists who have made a
name for themselves as illustrators of children’s
books is Lucy Fitch Perkins; fine examples
of her work are shown in “The Goose
Girl” and in Mrs. C. H. Harrison’s books,
“The Moon Prince,” “The Flaming Sword,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>and “Prince Silver Wings”; also in a series
called the “Dandelion Classics,” which include
“Robin Hood,” “Twenty Best Fairy
Tales,” “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “A
Wonder Book,” and “Æsop’s Fables.”</p>

<p class='c007'>During the last few years several artists
have achieved fame through their genius in
illustrating books for the young. Among the
more prominent of these are Arthur Rackham,
Edmund Dulac, and Warwick Goble.
Among the books illustrated by Arthur Rackham
are “Peter Pan,” “The Rainbow Book,”
“Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,” and
Grimm’s “Fairy Tales.” To Edmund Dulac
may be credited among others, “The
Arabian Nights,” and “The Sleeping Beauty.”</p>
